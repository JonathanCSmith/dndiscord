Randoms:

    [DONE] game:run tes didnt work for me
    tavern initialize overwrite or fuck up
    [DONE] check permission should output True or reason
    up enter
    currency weight
    currency iteration order
    tab complete
    [DONE] tavern bigger posts
    inventory bigger posts
    move away from stupid prefetch paradigm it messes with our permisson states too much
    personal inventories
    more localizations
    subcommands
    [DONE] water.state should just be services I think - I don't want to micro plumbing etc
    [DONE] conflation of land and garden properties in data pack
    Tavern data status if data pack not present - just better reporting required telling user that the data pack is missing
    [DONE] Tavern force change datapack? Should help with loading new versions?!
    [DONE] If i make a change to default data pack i would like to re-dump it into default with a command
    [DONE] Fix force reload so it doesnt load the default pack if it cant find the original
    Split up tavern status into multiple long messages
    get_purchaseable -> pre genned list
    Tavern() -> apply_history, find_applicable_purchases etc
    on_purchase -> find_applicable_purchases
    cannot dm on reload_translations
    untranslated view for easier pack creation?
